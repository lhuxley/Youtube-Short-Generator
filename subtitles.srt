1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
 Fine. Tell the truth.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,720
 Just give me a pound of flesh.

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,919
 What do you want?

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,519
 House wants to buy off of your skin. He sent me to get it.

5
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:17,460
 And you agreed?

6
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:21,140
 I had nothing to do with putting you in a coma or any of the subsequent tests.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,660
 Which brings us to now.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,460
 I read some of your articles.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,699
 There are a lot of them.

10
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,039
 1967, Massachusetts Medical Journal.

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,100
 You radiated babies. Just like that. No forms, no questions, nothing.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,079
 Who knows how many cancers you caused?

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,960
 I don't know.

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,899
 But I do know as we discovered techniques that prevent fatal kidney failures in hundreds of thousands of other kids.

15
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,679
 You're not sorry.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,479
 I don't regret what I did.

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,679
 Informed consent, patient rights, holdings, and so on.

18
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:57,340
 Don't expect research.
